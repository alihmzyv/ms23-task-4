=== Pushing all subprojects and running the application

Clean, build and push all subprojects and run the application using this command:

```
MS23_DOCKER_REGISTRY=your_docker_registry MS23_DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME=your_docker_registry_username MS23_DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="your_docker_registry_password" ./gradlew composeUp
```

Warning: the docker registry should have 2 repositories, named ms1 and ms2. You can use the command with the credentials of my public test docker hub registry which has those repositories:
```
MS23_DOCKER_REGISTRY=ms23test MS23_DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME=ms23test MS23_DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="ms123456$" ./gradlew composeUp
```

=== Using the application


* MS1 hello - `http://localhost:8000/ms1/hello`
* MS2 hello - `http://localhost:8000/ms2/hello`


=== Stopping the application

Stop the application using this command:

```
./gradlew :composeDown
```
